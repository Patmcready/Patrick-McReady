        <p>I'm a data-driven and results-oriented professional passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex business challenges. My expertise lies in data analytics, where I combine technical skills in Python (used for developing predictive models), Machine Learning (applied to customer segmentation projects), SQL (used for database management and analysis), Cyber Security and data visualization tools like Power BI and Excel (creating interactive dashboards to provide actionable insights) with a strong understanding of business principles. I'm adept at everything from cluster analysis and network administration to project management and even hardware installationâ€”a testament to my adaptable and quick-minded nature. My background isn't just technical; I also bring a collaborative spirit, honed through years of teamwork and leadership experience, including my service in the US Navy.</p>

        <p>What truly excites me about the world of technology and data science is its constant evolution. I thrive in environments that demand continuous learning and staying ahead of the curve. This drive has led me to pursue advanced education, including my current pursuit of a Master of Science in Management at the University of Illinois, followed by an MBA. I believe that combining technical expertise with strong management acumen is crucial for making a real impact in today's business world. I'm pursuing these degrees to develop the strategic leadership skills necessary to bridge the gap between technical expertise and business strategy, enabling me to lead data-driven initiatives at a strategic level, driving innovation and creating positive business outcomes.</p>

        <p>My journey has been shaped by diverse experiences, from growing up in Chicago and playing sports to serving in the US Navy, where I achieved the rank of Operations Specialist Petty Officer 3rd Class. This experience instilled in me discipline, leadership, and a commitment to excellence. My academic background includes an Associate's degree in General Studies from City Colleges, a Bachelor's in Computer Science with a concentration in Cyber Security from Northeastern Illinois University, and now my ongoing Master's degree. I also have a Career Essentials in Data Analysis by Microsoft and LinkedIn certification along with an IBM Cyber Securities Fundamentals. Outside of work, I enjoy unwinding with video games, wrestling, anime, and exploring the latest advancements in machine learning and AI. I'm currently seeking opportunities in data analytics, management, or cybersecurity where I can contribute my technical skills and leadership experience to a dynamic team. Feel free to connect with me to discuss how I can add value to your organization.</p>
